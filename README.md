# Stock Price Tool
Tool for loading stock prices and printing charts (aim to add statistical tools). App was first build upon the yahoo Finance API which is shut down right now. To make the App work in general again i replaced the loaded stock prices through random walks. Chart printing etc. is working now.

# Get started
First clone this repository by typing in a shell

    git clone https://github.com/matthias-bitzer/JavaStockPriceTool

I included also the compiled java bytecode so just type from the base directory of this git the following i a shell to start the program

    java -cp bin gui.App

Now the App is running.
